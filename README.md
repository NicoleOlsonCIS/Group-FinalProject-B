# Group-FinalProject-B

We did the revised version of Final Project-B, introducing three bugs into the code. 

The running of the tests involves both outputs to console and the creation of text documents. The text documents contain most of the test results however the results printed to console contain whitebox results and information in the instance of more serious runtime errors. 

There is a folder in this project called "example output files", which were generated on running the completed version of these tests. In some instances, where additional bugs are introduced, some of these output files do not get generated (because not all tests will be run under certain bug conditions), so these example files serve to show what they look like when run.
